The names of the drums are: Kenkeni, the smallest and the keeper of the time; Sangban, the middle one is the heart; Dununba gives power and heat to the rhythm as well adding great rhythmic dimension; the bells bring another tonality and fill the space between the beats. In some regions they play one or two. Only in Kurussa and Kankan region, they play all tree Dununs and bells.",

Composers have used pairs of four-voice choirs to fill the most vast of spaces: the great Spanish catedrales for which Victoria, Vivanco and Guerrero composed Song of Songs motets, and St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, where Giovanni da Palestrina’s profound setting of Stabat Mater was heard during his life. You’ll hear all these, as well as double-choir pieces by the modern composers Benjamin Britten, Steven Sametz, James MacMillan, and Paul Crabtree. Clerestory’s voices will combine in every permutation to illuminate this music that’s both intricate and otherworldly.",

This series features women musicians, dancers, and poets from around the world. The nights are filled with inspired culture, singing, dancing, drumming, performers in new groupings, once-only collaborations, and reunions of pioneering women musicians.\r\nThis is the big production: enchanting, colorful, and mesmerizing, as the dance troupe Hālau Ka Ua Tuahine features director Māhealani Uchiyama along with nine musicians and drummers, plus 33 dancers. Hālau Ka Ua Tuahine focuses on dances of Hawaiʻi and Tahiti. Started by Uchiyama more than 20 years ago, Hālau KaUaTuahine is the resident company of her Māhea Uchiyama Center for International Dance. The troupe is named after the gentle “sister” rain that falls in the valley of Mānoa in Honolulu. The dancers have won numerous awards and perform internationally, appearing in venues ranging from the Hollywood Bowl to the National Museum of New Zealand.\r\nThis is not hula for tourists, but the real thing – island dances that are both dazzling and deeply rooted in culture and history. “Classical Hawaiian hula is one of the world’s oldest sacred dance genres,” according to Uchiyama. “In its contemporary form it has also taken on more secular expressions. We focus on both styles, presenting classical hula as close to its original form as possible, along with vibrant modern interpretations. Though Tahitian dance does not share the same sacred underpinnings, it does have many different forms, both traditional and contemporary, that are exciting and beautiful.”",

No exceptions.\n\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\nYes\n \nWhat is the refund policy?\nNo refunds, sorry.\n \nErk's Bio\n \n\nErk Tha Jerk is not your every day, ordinary rap artist. In an era where the majority of artists are all sounding the same, looking the same, and doing the same things, Erk stands out as a real one of a kind artist. At first glance, you would not assume that Erk was a rapper/producer/songwriter, but with his trademark glasses, wit, and laid back persona, he brings something that your average music listener can embrace and relate to. He explains, “Being myself is a must. That’s the kind of music I make. Real sh*t. I don’t feel the same everyday. Some days I’m on my get money sh*t, then the next I’m on my chill at home sh*t. I just make sure everybody can relate”.\nErk found that finding credible production to accompany his lyrics would not be an easy task, which led him to start teaching himself the art of making beats. After some time, Erk’s production talents had become quite formidable, and he produced all of his own work, and other artists began seeking him out to produce their work as well.\nEven though his status as a producer was growing, his heart has always been in his raps. In late 2007, he dropped “The Hood Nerd” mixtape, which created some buzz around him as an artist, and got the streets talking. The song “Dont need Em” became a favorite of DJ’s and listeners, and has been getting significant plays on 106.1 KMEL. In order to capitalize off the building buzz, Erk released “The Hood Nerd EP” exclusively on Itunes featuring the hit song “Dont Need Em”, which is a precursor to an upcoming album, which is in the making. In June 2008, Erk released “Im So Dumb” which is a witty, comedic song satirizing the “Hyphy Movement”, and effectively pronouncing it dead. The song has been receiving praise from all over the region for its blunt honesty, and has been considered a long overdue message by many of the most powerful figures and artists in the local scene.\n",

        "text": "Door 7:30 / Show 8\r\nThe original Allman Brothers Band performed regularly at New York's Fillmore East Auditorium run by legendary promoter Bill Graham and often referred to as the 'church of rock and roll.' The Allman Brothers Band played often enough at Fillmore East to be called 'Bill Graham's house band.' It was here and at other New York metropolitan area venues like Passaic New jersey's Central and Capital Theaters, New York's Central Park's Schaefer Summer Concert Series where I heard the band many times beginning in 1970 and finally in July of 1971 at the closing of Fillmore East. I was there for the Friday night late show, the one the ABB band calls 'the show,' the one they feel is the greatest performance they ever gave. I can't say I've heard them or any other band give a better performance. Sadly, the next time I heard the band was a few months later at New York's Academy of Music. It was without its leader, Duane Allman, who had died only weeks before in a motorcycle accident near his home in Macon, Georgia. It was the most solemn rock concert I have ever attended. These shows left an indelible impression on me and I had already formed 'Skydog,' what may have been the very first Allman Brothers tribute band earlier that year.\r\nLIVE AT THE FILLMORE is the continuation of my devotion to performing the music of the original Allman Brothers Band as it was performed in those early years before the untimely deaths of Duane and Berry Oakley and the departure of Dickey Betts. For me, those years were the 'glory days' of the Allman Brothers Band. Unlike others who believe the band was a jam band, I share the view of Gregg Allman, who has been quoted as recently as 2003 by fellow band member Butch Trucks in stating that rather than being a jam band The Allman Brothers are \"a band that jams.\" My perspective on the music is that rather than completely freeform in its structure, form and content it is a body of work largely composed after much trial and error and 'jamming' in order to extract those elements which ultimately became part of the finished songs. Anyone like myself who had the good fortune to hear the Allman Brothers shows 'back in the day' on the same or successive nights will corroborate that though they did leave room for improvisation and personal expression, for the most part the songs remained the same. This has continued to be my approach to performing their music. Along with the other highly talented and committed musicians in LIVE AT THE FILLMORE, this is my attempt to bring back authentically the performances of the original Allman Brothers Band for those who were there to hear and still remember them along with those who have a similar love of this music and wish they had been there with us. We hope you enjoy listening to LIVE AT THE FILLMORE!

Furnace is a highly revealing and deeply personal offering from accomplished singer and songwriter Dave Simonett, who performs under the pseudonym Dead Man Winter.\nWidely known as the lead vocalist and songwriter for the acclaimed band Trampled By Turtles, Simonett has touched legions of fans with his thoughtful lyrics and warm tenor. However, the Minnesota native had some recent life-altering experiences to contend with and realized that he had to utilize a completely different vessel to do so. After 14 years of leading the successful progressive bluegrass outfit, Simonett chose to put the band on hold, and for the first time, dedicate an entire album to one topic.\nThe 10 songs that comprise Furnace reflect a man coming to terms with a painful divorce and the heartbreaking separation from his two children. While Simonett did not initially set out to chronicle these experiences, the process proved to be cathartic and highly therapeutic. The songwriter spent time in a cabin during the 20-below Minnesota winter and just wrote. The pent up emotions poured out of him and into songs such as the haunting “This House Is On Fire”, the reflective Byrds-styled “Destroyer” and the rollicking confessional “Am I Breaking Down”, to name a few.\nWhile the songs on Furnace are deep, introspective and at times, venomous, this is not at all a morose sounding album. Simonett recorded with longtime friends from the Minneapolis rock scene — drummer JT Bates, guitarist Erik Koskinen, bassist Tim Saxhaug, and keyboardist Bryan Nichols. The album was recorded live to tape at the historic Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, MN, where Nirvana’s In Utero was recorded.\nHowever difficult or joyous they are, our experiences shape who we are. At times these experiences can create an internal roadblock that we too often retreat from when we really need to push through. Furnace documents an artist who has burst through these emotional barricades, and the timing could not be more right.\nTICKET INFORMATION \n• Slim's is an ALL AGES (6+) venue.\n• No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.
