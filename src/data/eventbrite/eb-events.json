NYC's official #1 brass band for BalkanSoul RomaFunk.

Picture this... you smiling, enjoying the odd metered bliss that is Balkan music, your feet stomping the floor even if you don't know where the down beat is! Who cares, let the music take you away! No four on the floor or Turbo Folk at Kafana Balkan - no electronic thump watered down for appeal to undiscerning ears. Only the real deal Balkan feel.

DJ Željko has discriminating taste, a seemingly endless collection of great Balkan albums, and love and joy for his music, a crowd-pleasing, danceable Balkan brass sound. Since February 2015, he's joined by Marco Peris Coppola, Creative Co Strategist and Co Booker , who now together with DJ Željko Petkovic builds a major force in the ongoing evolution of the Bay Area Balkan Scene. \nThere will be Rakija -delectible Serbian plum brandy.

Hailing from the San Francisco Bay area, this trio effortlessly and elegantly traverses the space between 70’s hard rock and punk, gospel, swamp-blues, country, metal, and psychedelic rock, with a powerful, soulful female voice and a story to tell. Under the watchful eye of Venus and some smoldering incense, the band came to life in 2012. Divine forces brought together singer/guitarist Wendy Lee Gadzuk (The 440s), bassist/percussionist Jeff Vengeance (Flesh Eaters) and drummer Paul Jarvis (Skinlab) with a shared mission: Bring good music to the people. \n     2013 saw the release of their debut EP, produced by Brent Woods. The record garnered rave reviews, in particular for their songwriting, which Black Hole Magazine claims is “top-notch,\" while Drunken Werewolf states that their “songs are bloody ace,\" comparing the band to Nick Cave and Patti Smith. \n     In 2015, the band self-released a new EP, \"First Stone\" on both CD and vinyl, as well as a video for the title track, directed by independent filmmaker Phillip Vielma. This release is more a bit more raw than their debut EP and sees the band moving in a slightly heavier, more psychedelic direction, while still holding fast to their melodic roots. Singer/guitarist Wendy Lee Gadzuk’s mixed media art is featured on the cover, combining her passions while creating a strong visual identity for the band. \n     Staying true to their DIY ethos, Andalusia Rose has forged a reputation for their exciting live shows, both visually and musically, which solidified after a number of regional tours. “As the band plays, the room reverberates with a groovy, rumbling musical force that hits you right in the solar plexus, yet the songs are so well-crafted that you want to bob your head along.” - SF Bam Magazine. They have shared stages with such heavy hitters as The Flesh Eaters, Scott Ian’s Motor Sister, Gamma, Scott H. Biram, and the Picturebooks. Their music has been played regularly on Little Steven’s Underground Garage, as well as several other independent radio shows, and can be heard on Pandora Radio. Their song “Destroyer” is featured on the Classic Rock Magazine CD, “Stone Deaf Forever,” in issue 220 (Feb 2016), with Lemmy on the cover. They are slated to release a split 7” in Europe in early 2016. \n\"Their music shreds with a wicked blend of blues, soul, and hard rock. It's like Credence Clearwater Revival meet Heart while sharing a 5th of whiskey on the bayou.

Now what we have to do is employ our skill to tell the dramatic story of our people and what we’ve been through.” Max Roach, 1960 \nWe Insist! Freedom Now Suite was the first overtly political jazz album long-playing (LP) record featuring poetry and songs advocating for equality and justice. Recorded and released in 1960 on Candid Records to critical acclaim, We Insist! remains a landmark musical milestone composed by band leader/percussionist Max Roach in collaboration with poet Oscar Brown, Jr. In commemoration of the courage of their forbearers’ convictions and commitment to human rights, Dr. Anthony Brown’s GRAMMY-nominated Asian American Orchestra, re-imagines this significant project to share its timeless message of social and racial justice and its continuing relevance to today’s #BlackLivesMatter Movement and the upsurge of anti-Muslim violence.  \nWe Insist! Freedom Now Suite 2016 premieres in early June at the San Francisco International Arts Festival. The Musically Minded Academy performance marks the East Bay debut.To begin the evening, Musically Minded’s Artistic Director Jim Bennett will lead a discussion with Dr. Anthony Brown, lyricst/vocalist Amikaeyla, and poet Genny Lim on the historic significance of the original We Insist!

He has composed music for critically acclaimed, award winning film documentaries, theater productions, dance companies and musical ensembles internationally, and has collaborated with Max Roach, Cecil Taylor, Zakir Hussain, Steve Lacy, Anthony Davis and the San Francisco Symphony. Dr. Brown has served as Curator of American Musical Culture and Director of the Jazz Oral History Program at the Smithsonian Institution, and as a Visiting Professor of Music at UC Berkeley.  \nSince 1998, this San Francisco-based Orchestra has received international critical acclaim for blending Asian musical instruments and sensibilities with the sonorities and improvisation of the jazz orchestra. Their recording of Duke Ellington- Billy Strayhorn’s Far East Suite received a 2000 GRAMMY nomination for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance. The Orchestra’s recording, Monk’s Moods: Music of Thelonious Monk with guest Steve Lacy, was rated a “Five-star masterpiece” and “Best CD of 2003” by Downbeat magazine. Anthony Brown’s 2005 release, Rhapsodies, features his recomposition of Gershwin’s Rhapsody In Blue which he completed as a 2003 Guggenheim Fellow. In 2010, the Asian American Orchestra released India & Africa: A Tribute to John Coltrane Recorded Live at Yoshi’s to international critical acclaim. \nhttp://fifthstreammusic.org \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  ",

        "text": "Come.Run.Wild. Doors 7pm, Show 8pm SHARP  \n$10 Presale / $12 Doors \n Wax Idols You could say that a lot has happened since the release of Wax Idols’ critically well-received 2013 album, Discipline + Desire, and if you’re steeped in the shorthand of music criticism go-to narratives, it would be dangerously easy to get reductive about what happened next: The band’s singer-songwriter, Hether Fortune, supported the album as best she could, spent some time in 2014 as a touring player in White Lung, went through a heartbreaking divorce, and then sat down to make American Tragic – the band’s long-awaited third album and ﬁrst for Collect Records. But that’s not exactly how it went.  “Divorce is a part of this record, yes, but this is not an entirely sad album,” Fortune explains. “The whole spectrum of grief is represented here — shock, pain, anger, loneliness, and then ﬁnding a way to work through all of that and not only survive, but thrive. That’s what I was going through.”  In that sense, American Tragic stands out in the Wax Idols catalog for its profound empathy — elegiac in its approach, but connective by nature. Songs like “Lonely You” and “Goodbye Baby” divide the line between kiss-me and kiss-off, while others, such as “At Any Moment” or “Deborah,” provide deep emotional contrasts between their upbeat musical approach and downright icy lyrical counterparts. To say, then, that this is simply a break-up album is to sell short an idea that Fortune has been playing with over the entire arc of Wax Idols’ discography, and that is the notion that identity is neither ﬁxed nor consistent: We can be independent and attached, in need of discipline and desire, or even fully autonomous with a little bit of help. As Fortune points out here, even America, for all its symbolism and mythic value, also rests in tragedy.  Website: http://wax-idols.com/Twitter: https://twitter.com/WAXIDOLSFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/waxidols/  King Woman Bay Area's King Woman is comprised of Kristina Esfandiari, Colin Gallagher, Joey Raygoza, and Peter Arensdorf.  Kristina Esfandiari originally formed King Woman back in 2009 as a solo project which later turned into a full band. Their debut EP \"Doubt\" touches on some heavy topics and allows Esfandiari's lyrical ingenuity to really shine; with nods to issues like religious abuse, the four resulting tracks are cathartic, brooding, and hypnotic. The record was recorded with Patrick Hills (Tera Melos, 7 Seconds, So Stressed) at Earth Tone in Sacramento, CA in 2015. The band wears their musical influence on their sleeve: \"We love bands like Black Sabbath, OM, Neurosis and Jesu\", said Kristina, and with her lush and dramatic vocals not unlike Mazzy Star, King Woman has created a sound all their own.  Since the release of \"Doubt\" King Woman have played shows with bands such as: Ceremony, Planning For Burial, A Place to Bury Strangers, Weekend, and True Widow, leaving audiences speechless and ravenous for more. Their first full length album “Created in the Image of Suffering”, recorded at Jack Shirley’s Atomic Garden, is set to come out in 2016 as one of the most anticipated releases of the year.

As Fortune points out here, even America, for all its symbolism and mythic value, also rests in tragedy.<BR><BR>Website: <A TARGET=\"_blank\" HREF=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwax-idols.com%2FTwitter&h=nAQFWl4DU&enc=AZMDNhCAW0v0EMwQ8uRmRwb750OE5ekyo0Zfi_bQnr9htH78tWd0pI8hR_rXAigGx4g&s=1\" REL=\"nofollow\">http://wax-idols.com/<SPAN CLASS=\"word_break\"></SPAN>Twitter</A>: <A TARGET=\"_blank\" HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FWAXIDOLS&h=sAQGeYz-6&enc=AZNHFkULPkjoNg4TmUVd0tYmj1VmNSccTqEtE8FQYwydvpq0XEQdi7JdRjw5wcFa-LU&s=1\" REL=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/<SPAN CLASS=\"word_break\"></SPAN>WAXIDOLS</A>Facebook: <A TARGET=\"_blank\" HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/waxidols/\" REL=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/<SPAN CLASS=\"word_break\"></SPAN>waxidols/</A><BR><BR><A TARGET=\"_blank\" HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/KNGWMN/\" REL=\"nofollow\">King Woman</A><BR>Bay Area's King Woman is comprised of Kristina Esfandiari, Colin Gallagher, Joey Raygoza, and Peter Arensdorf. <BR>Kristina Esfandiari originally formed King Woman back in 2009 as a solo project which later turned into a full band. Their debut EP \"Doubt\" touches on some heavy topics and allows Esfandiari's lyrical ingenuity to really shine; with nods to issues like religious abuse, the four resulting tracks are cathartic, brooding, and hypnotic. The record was recorded with Patrick Hills (Tera Melos, 7 Seconds, So Stressed) at Earth Tone in Sacramento, CA in 2015. The band wears their musical influence on their sleeve: \"We love bands like Black Sabbath, OM, Neurosis and Jesu\", said Kristina, and with her lush and dramatic vocals not unlike Mazzy Star, King Woman has created a sound all their own.<BR><BR>Since the release of \"Doubt\" King Woman have played shows with bands such as: Ceremony, Planning For Burial, A Place to Bury Strangers, Weekend, and True Widow, leaving audiences speechless and ravenous for more. Their first full length album “Created in the Image of Suffering”, recorded at Jack Shirley’s Atomic Garden, is set to come out in 2016 as one of the most anticipated releases of the year.<BR><BR>Twitter: <A TARGET=\"_blank\" HREF=\"https://twitter.com/kngwmn\" REL=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/kngwmn</A> <BR>Tumblr: <A TARGET=\"_blank\" HREF=\"http://kristinaesfandiari.tumblr.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">http://<SPAN CLASS=\"word_break\"></SPAN>kristinaesfandiari.tumblr.c<SPAN CLASS=\"word_break\"></SPAN>om/</A><BR><BR>Featuring Special Guest <A TARGET=\"_blank\" HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/thisisplush/\" REL=\"nofollow\">PLUSH</A> to open the night!<BR><A TARGET=\"_blank\" HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fplushsf.bandcamp.com%2F&h=1AQH517ng&enc=AZPo7RG24P6DpKXN_Jz7UZHD7BqxriicaoX8J4SKN96kB8JYPs3IE4AZdRqXoDIIXjM&s=1\" REL=\"nofollow\">https://<SPAN CLASS=\"word_break\"></SPAN>plushsf.bandcamp.com/</A><BR><BR><A TARGET=\"_blank\" HREF=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oaktownindiemayhem.com%2F&h=iAQGAL4CL&enc=AZPDFDftQ3KnM84mmJMgp-oXmOg0yB17gdeWRczsehBkoSe4V1OmwRVTqYfOa07c5kg&s=1\" REL=\"nofollow\">www.oaktownindiemayhem.com</A></SPAN></P>"

People with tickets must come before 10:30 pm.  \n Rayven's Bio: \n  \nThe Bay area (East Oakland) streets are on fire with the hot new R&B singer – Rayven Justice – burning up the local airwaves with his scorching beat “Slide Thru” that’s receiving massive airplay on San Francisco’s KMEL. He named his New Album “I Have A Dream” after his successful debut of his mixtape and now his single Slide Through is making a major impact across the country. Everything is sliding in the right direction for Rayven Justice! \n  \nThere are many artists in the Bay Area, but Rayven Justice’s passion and motivation sets him apart from the rest. He has come a long way, from being part of a group with his younger brother Raymen Justice. The brothers seemed bound for a bright music career, then Raymen was tragically shot and killed near Oakland High on September 21, 2010. This was a very difficult time for Rayven. “My brother’s death put me in a dark place and I had thoughts of suicide. I wouldn’t eat or drink and had multiple panic attacks. When I returned home from the hospital I laid in my brother’s bed and thought to myself, what would he want me to do? “So from that moment on I committed all my time to my music.” This life shattering event influenced Rayven to push even harder with his music, as a lifelong tribute to his little brother Raymen. \n  \nRayven’s dedication to his music has given him amazing results. He currently has songs with a host of major artists and anticipates the release of his debut album “I Have A Dream” with fan favorite tracks such as Slide Thru, Might As Well, On Mama’s Ft. TeFlii and Problem, I See You Ft. Kool John, and the smash gone viral Hit Or Nah. Through hard work, Rayven has also created his own clothing line called, EXACTLY – a name that symbolizes Rayven’s focus. “Life is too short to be vague about what you want out of it. It’s about being absolutely, completely, and totally who you are and the statement you are making to the world, that statement should be greatness which is what my clothes represent,” stated Justice. \n  \nNow, he has his own label and he’s enjoying success on his own terms as “Slide Thru” has amassed over 450,000 views. Complex Magazine named Justice’ song Slide Thru as listed “10 dope songs you should be hearing everywhere soon,” and “Deep Cuts: Under- the – radar jam you need to hear” including his new single. As a testament to Rayven’s rising success his sales are steady and constantly growing. Rayven Justice opened at KMEL’s annual Summer Jam concert at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, CA. The Crowd singing every word of Slide Thru for Rayven was in a wild frenzy over the young artist. “I couldn’t believe they didn’t let me sing one word, a truly amazing feeling in my home town,” stated a genuinely humbled Justice. The Summer Jam which was at The Oracle Arena in Oakland, CA, has featured heavy hitter artist’s the likes of Kendrick Lamar, 2 Chainz, Rick Ross, Big Sean and J. Cole in the past.bcx \n  \nRayven Justice, career has taken a sharp business turned by partnering up with Rita Lee the CEO of Nuface Entertainment. “It was the smartest thing I could have done!” Justice confided to reporters. Rita Lee took him under her wing polished the artist with 100% talent, intelligence and built a team for Rayven Justice Music. ",

        "text": "Dick Dale's real name Richard Anthony Monsour born on May 4th, 1937 wasn't nicknamed “Guitar Legend\" for nothing as he has invented the style single-handedly, Surf/Rock based on Gene Krupa’s Drum rhythm and the indigenous people plus the wild animals roars as the sounds are part of his guitar playing and he is the Pioneer and Creator along with then like second father Leo Fender of Fender Equipment. Leo tested everything on Dick. No matter who copied or expanded upon Dicks Genius blueprint, he remained the fieriest, most technically gifted musician the genre ever produced and is considered the Worlds second most influential guitarist on the planet…God only knows who the first is? Dale's pioneering use of Middle Eastern and Eastern European melodies (learned organically through his familial heritage) was among the first in any genre of American popular music, and predated the teaching of such \"exotic\" scales in guitar-shredder academies by two decades. The breakneck speed of his single-note staccato picking technique was unrivalled until it entered the repertoires of metal virtuosos like Eddie Van Halen, and his wild showmanship made an enormous impression on the young Jimi Hendrix. But those aren't the only reasons Dale was once called the father of heavy metal. Working closely with the Fender company, Dale continually pushed the limits of electric amplification technology, helping to develop new equipment that was capable of producing the thick, clearly defined tones he heard in his head, at the previously undreamed-of volumes he demanded. He also pioneered the use of portable reverb effects, creating a signature sonic texture for surf instrumentals. And, if all that weren't enough, Dale managed to redefine his instrument while essentially playing it upside-down and backwards -- he switched sides in order to play left-handed, but without re-stringing it (as Hendrix later did).  Dick’s father was Lebanese, his mother Polish. As a child, he was exposed to folk music from both cultures, which had an impact on his sense of melody and the ways string instruments could be picked. He also heard lots of big band swing, and found his first musical hero in drummer Gene Krupa, who later wound up influencing a percussive approach to guitar so intense that Dale regularly broke the heaviest-gauge strings available and ground his picks down to nothing several times in the same song. He taught himself to play country songs on the ukulele, and soon graduated to guitar, where he was also self-taught. His father encouraged him and offered career guidance, and in 1954, the family moved to Southern California. At the suggestion of a country DJ, Monsour adopted the stage name Dick Dale, and began performing in local talent shows, where his budding interest in rockabilly made him a popular act. He recorded a demo song, \"Ooh-Whee Marie,\" for the local Del-Fi label, which was later released as a single on his father's new Del-Tone imprint and distributed locally. During the late '50s, Dale also became an avid surfer, and soon set about finding ways to mimic the surging sounds and feelings of the sport and the ocean on his guitar. He quickly developed a highly distinctive instrumental sound, and found an enthusiastic, ready-made audience in his surfer friends. Dale began playing regular gigs at the Rendezvous Ballroom, a once-defunct concert venue near Newport Beach, with his backing band the Del-Tones; as word spread and gigs at other local halls followed, Dale became a wildly popular attraction, drawing 1,000s of fans to every performance. In September 1961, Del-Tone released Dale's single \"Let's Go Trippin',\" which is generally acknowledged to be the very first recorded surf/Rock instrumentals. \"Let's Go Trippin'\" was a huge local hit, and even charted nationally. Dale released a few more local singles, including \"Jungle Fever,\" \"Miserlou,\" and \"Surf Beat,\" and in 1962 issued his (and surf music's) first album, the groundbreaking Surfer's Choice, on Del-Tone. Surfer's Choice sold like hotcakes around Southern California, which earned Dale a contract with Capitol Records and national distribution for Surfer's Choice. Dale was featured in Life magazine in 1963, which led to appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and the Frankie/Annette film Beach Party; he also released the follow-up LP King of the Surf Guitar, and went on to issue three more albums on Capitol through 1965. During that time, he developed a close working relationship with Leo Fender, who kept engineering bigger and better sound systems in response to Dale's appetite for louder, more maniacally energetic live performances. Surf music became a national fad, with groups like the Beach Boys and Jan & Dean offering a vocal variant to complement the wave of instrumental groups, all of which were indebted in some way to Dale. But in 1964, the British Invasion stole much of surf's thunder, and Dale was dropped by Capitol in 1965. He remained a wildly popular local act, but in 1966, he was diagnosed with rectal cancer, which forced him to temporarily retire from music. He beat the disease, however, and soon began pursuing other interests: owning and caring for a variety of endangered animals, studying martial arts, designing his parents' dream house, and learning to pilot planes. In 1979, a puncture wound suffered while surfing off Newport Beach led to a pollution-related infection that nearly cost him his leg; Dale soon added environmental activist to his resumé. In addition to all of that, Dale performed occasionally around Southern California throughout the '70s and '80s. In 1986, Dale attempted to mount a comeback. He first recorded a benefit single for the UC-Irvine Medical Center's burn unit (which had helped him recuperate from potentially serious injuries), and the following year appeared in the beach-movie sendup Back to the Beach. The soundtrack featured a duet between Dale and Stevie Ray Vaughan on the Chantays' surf staple \"Pipeline,\" which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental. In 1991, Dale did a guest spot on an album by the San Francisco-based Psychefunkapus, and a successful Bay Area gig got him signed with Hightone Records. The album Tribal Thunder was released in 1993, but Dale's comeback didn't get into full swing until, in 1994, \"Miserlou\" was chosen as the opening theme to Quentin Tarantino's blockbuster film Pulp Fiction. \"Miserlou\" became synonymous with Pulp Fiction's ultra-hip sense of style, and was soon licensed in countless commercials (as were several other Dale tracks). As a result, Tribal Thunder and its 1994 follow-up Unknown Territory attracted lots of attention, earning positive reviews and surprisingly strong sales. In 1996, he supported the Beggars Banquet album Calling Up Spirits by joining the normally punk- and ska-oriented Warped Tour. Dale refocused on touring over the years in the past along with owning two of the largest nightclubs in Southern Ca. . He returned years ago with a new CD in 2001, Spacial Disorientation and then much more has happened in his later years. Dick is married to the love of his entire life Lana Dale as Lana Dale is Dick’s Manager/Booking Agent/PR/Filmographer and Photographer and as well over the years has created all of the Dick Dale Merch.

        "html": "<P>Dick Dale's real name Richard Anthony Monsour born on May 4th, 1937 wasn't nicknamed “Guitar Legend\" for nothing as he has invented the style single-handedly, Surf/Rock based on Gene Krupa’s Drum rhythm and the indigenous people plus the wild animals roars as the sounds are part of his guitar playing and he is the Pioneer and Creator along with then like second father Leo Fender of Fender Equipment. Leo tested everything on Dick. No matter who copied or expanded upon Dicks Genius blueprint, he remained the fieriest, most technically gifted musician the genre ever produced and is considered the Worlds second most influential guitarist on the planet…God only knows who the first is? Dale's pioneering use of Middle Eastern and Eastern European melodies (learned organically through his familial heritage) was among the first in any genre of American popular music, and predated the teaching of such \"exotic\" scales in guitar-shredder academies by two decades. The breakneck speed of his single-note staccato picking technique was unrivalled until it entered the repertoires of metal virtuosos like Eddie Van Halen, and his wild showmanship made an enormous impression on the young Jimi Hendrix. But those aren't the only reasons Dale was once called the father of heavy metal. Working closely with the Fender company, Dale continually pushed the limits of electric amplification technology, helping to develop new equipment that was capable of producing the thick, clearly defined tones he heard in his head, at the previously undreamed-of volumes he demanded. He also pioneered the use of portable reverb effects, creating a signature sonic texture for surf instrumentals. And, if all that weren't enough, Dale managed to redefine his instrument while essentially playing it upside-down and backwards -- he switched sides in order to play left-handed, but without re-stringing it (as Hendrix later did).  Dick’s father was Lebanese, his mother Polish. As a child, he was exposed to folk music from both cultures, which had an impact on his sense of melody and the ways string instruments could be picked.
